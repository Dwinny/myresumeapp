This app is a  basic resume mobile app, it has a profile picture, name and also a username, also social media links . It is a one-code base app using flutter . I used the url launcher to enable the links work properly. I would have added more screens that is for experience and background. I would have also made the User Interface better. I had issues getting the APK link but I was able to solve that by asking a fellow intern about it. I also faced challenges with my vs code which made my app crash multiple times.
