# myresumeapp
This app is a one screen basic mobile app, it has a profile picture, name and also a username, it also consists of social media links that works. It is a one-code base app using flutter/dart to write the code . It is just a simple design with accessible links . I used the url launcher to enable the links work properly. I would have added more screens that is for experience and background. I would have also made the User Interface better. I had issues getting the APK link for the app but I was able to solve it by moving my app to google drive. I also had a bit of issues with generating the appetize apk link but I was able to solve that by asking a fellow intern about it. I also faced challenges with my visual studio code which made my app crash multiple times and made me submit late. I also faced challenges in getting a design for the app, i just had a create on myself because of the short time we had. Appetize.io link: https://appetize.io/app/xksmlhvwavybkaqt4vys4imssu
